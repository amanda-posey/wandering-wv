# Checklist for Project 2

- [x] Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow. You will be able to start your app from the auth boilerplate built w/ in-class code-alongs.

- [ ] Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) that represents the main functional idea for your app. This doesn't include join tables or the user model which should be part of your class's boilerplate code. Note: If your app idea doesn't really call for more models, let your instructors know and they can suggest ideas for other sufficiently difficult replacements for this requirement.

- [ ] Incorporate at least one third-party API.

- [ ] Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources (models) with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

- [x] Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data

- [ ] Include a readme file that explains how to use your app (also how to set up the db, obtain api keys, what environment variables are needed, etc, so anyone can fork and clone your app then run it locally

- [ ] Have semantically clean HTML, CSS, and back-end code

- [ ] Be deployed online and accessible to the public (we will do a lesson in class on deployment to heroku)
